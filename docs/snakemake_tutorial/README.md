Snakemake has a lot of functionality so we are going to start with the basics and then look to apply what we learn to more complex scenarios in the afternoon.

You need would normally need to do some [setup](http://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/setup.html "snakemake tutorial setup") before you move onto the [snakemake tutorial](http://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/basics.html) basics.

We have taken care of most of it for you but you need to download the actual data files so go to [Section 2](http://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/setup.html#step-2-preparing-a-working-directory) of the setup page and follow the instructions for steps 2, 3 and 4.
