# Snakemake tutorial setup

Snakemake has a lot of functionality so we are going to start with the basics and then look to apply what we learn to more complex scenarios in the afternoon.

You need would normally need to do some [setup](http://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/setup.html "snakemake tutorial setup") before you move onto the [snakemake tutorial](http://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/basics.html) basics.

We have taken care of this part and the necessary files are here:

/home/ubuntu/hpdm098/workshops/snakemake_tutorial/snakemake-tutorial-data-5.24.1

Which is also a good space for you to complete the tutorial.

It is reccommended as a minimum that you read it prior to starting the assignment.
